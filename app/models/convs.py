        in_channels (int): Same as nn.Conv2d.

        kernel_size (int or tuple[int]): Same as nn.Conv2d.

        padding (int or tuple[int]): Same as nn.Conv2d.
        dilation (int or tuple[int]): Same as nn.Conv2d.
        groups (int): Same as nn.Conv2d.
        bias (bool or str): If specified as `auto`, it will be decided by the
            False.
        activation (str or None): Activation type, "ReLU" by default.
        inplace (bool): Whether to use inplace mode for activation.
        order (tuple[str]): The order of conv/norm/activation layers. It is a
